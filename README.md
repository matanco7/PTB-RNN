# PTB-RNN

Experimentation with the Penn Tree Bank data set. In this data set we predict the next word.
Architechture is derived from the "small" model as described in "Recurrent Neural
Network Regularization", by Zaremba et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2329

Four different models were implemented: LSTM/GRU with/without dropout. All configurations are clearly overfitted to the data sets and require further improvements.
